# technology of teamwork

!SLIDE

* one constant in our field is collaboration
* tech assisting us always improving
* methodologies too!

!SLIDE

# some common ones

* waterfall, spiral
* agile, extreme, scrum

!SLIDE

# tools augment processes

* how do you work?
* how can you work better?
* what's out there to help?

!SLIDE

# common tools

* OS, editor, ide
* docs, tests
* revision control

# and yes, git!

!SLIDE

# essentials

* low level content tracker (SHA1/DAG/etc)
* distributed
* simplifies parallel development
* emphasis on pull, not push

!SLIDE

# commits

!SLIDE

# branches

* points where commits diverge
* can be merged with eachother
* exist on your machine or elsewhere

!SLIDE

!SLIDE

# refs

* labels for particular commits
* like svn tags
* HEAD a special ref to a ref, marks beginning

!SLIDE

!SLIDE

# remotes

* like svn repos but awesomer
* friends instead of svn servers
* push to, pull from. bring in changes

!SLIDE

!SLIDE

# distributed

* all changes are on your machine
* you're free to inspect and change
* no wifi? no problem
